# Getting started with ilert mobile app

With the ilert mobile app, you can take full control of your incident response wherever you are: view and act on alerts (accept, resolve, escalate), manage incidents, check on-call schedules and escalation policies, review call logs, and oversee maintenance windows, heartbeat checks, service uptime, and status pages—all from a single, intuitive interface. The mobile app empowers you to take the first critical steps toward incident response and remediation on the go, ensuring you’re always ready to act.

Sign in to your ilert account:

* **Email & Password:** Enter your credentials and tap **Sign In**.

If you don't yet have an ilert account, you will need to [create it first via the desktop application](https://app.ilert.com/signup).&#x20;

### Enable push notifications

You can turn on push notifications in two ways:

1. **Notification screens**\
   Enable immediately after your first login using the in-app onboarding screens.
2. **Manual settings**\
   If you skipped the cards, enable notifications via the app’s Settings menu later.

### Notification s**creens**

After your first login, you’ll see these screens. They aim to help you set up the push notifications. Swipe **left** or **right** to navigate between them, or tap **Not Now** to skip all.

5. Tap **Go to settings**.
6. In your device’s Settings, tap **Allow notifications** for ilert.
7. Return to the ilert app—push notifications are now enabled.
