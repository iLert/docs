# iLert Release Notes

## May 2020

### New features

* [Stakeholder engagement](getting-started/stakeholder-engagement.md): keep stakeholders in the loop during critical incidents \([blog post](https://www.ilert.com/blog/2020-05-27-stakeholder-engagement-release-notes/)\).

### New and updated integrations

* [AWS Personal Health Dashboard](integrations/aws-phd.md)
* [StatusCake](integrations/statuscake.md)
* Serverless outbound integrations:
  * [AWS Lambda](integrations/aws-lambda.md)
  * [Google Cloud Functions](integrations/gcf.md)
  * [Microsoft Azure Functions](integrations/azure-functions.md)
* [Icinga v2.x](integrations/icinga.md) \(updated\): there is a dedicated plugin for Icinga now on our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/iLert/ilert-icinga). You can now override the incident priority from within Icinga and we include the comments that you enter in Icinga when ackâ€™ing a problem in the event log of the incident.
* [JIRA](integrations/jira.md) \(updated\): When you setup a connection from your alert source in iLert to your JIRA instance, projects and issue types are now dynamically fetched from your JIRA instance, so you can select the issue types when iLert syncs an incident to JIRA. You can even include custom fields.
* [Webhook](integrations/webhook.md) \(updated\): you can now fully customize the payload for outbound webhooks.

### Improvements

* [API end point](https://api.ilert.com/api-docs/#tag/Uptime-Monitors) for uptime monitors
* Uptime monitors: support for milliseconds in check timeout \([blog post](https://www.ilert.com/blog/2020-05-27-stakeholder-engagement-release-notes/#uptime-monitoring)\)
* Flexible periods in repeating on-call schedules: set an arbitrary period length and chose between days and weeks as the period unit \([blog post](https://www.ilert.com/blog/2020-05-27-stakeholder-engagement-release-notes/#flexible-periods)\)
