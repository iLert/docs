## FAQ

### I lost my authenticator app / TOPT generator / device how can I access my account?

If you have lost your app or device you may use your recovery-codes, handed out during initial setup of your 2FA to get access to the account. **Note**: you were handed out 5 recovery codes only and each becomes burnt when it is used. So it is highly adviced to immediately use the recovery codes to access and remove 2FA from your account (requires at least 2 recovery codes). Once removed you may setup 2FA again using a new device / app.

In case you were using a FIDO device or you have lost / burnt your recovery codes you will need to contact [iLert support](../contact.md#support) providing additional details of verification e.g. passport to have 2FA reset from your account.
