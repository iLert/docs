# Getting started with call routing

## **What is Call Routing?**

Call routing is an add-on in ilert, designed to ensure incoming phone calls and voicemails are efficiently directed to the appropriate on-call responder. Calls are routed via ilert's intricate on-call schedules and escalation policies. With call routing, you are assigned a static, dedicated phone number (either local or toll-free, subject to availability). This number then intelligently and dynamically routes calls or voicemails to the current on-call responder in ilert.

## Prerequisites

To access and utilize call routing, you must be on the Professional plan or a higher tier. Once you have purchased the call routing add-on, contact ilert support at support@ilert.com to activate a phone number in your account.

**Phone number availability is subject to regulation**

Due to country-specific regulations, phone number provisioning may require identity documentation and location validation. Contact support@ilert.com to check availability in your desired locality.

## Viewing provisioned phone numbers

Once a call routing number was provisioned from ilert support, you'll find your call routing numbers in the navigation bar at the top under **Call routing** -> **Phone numbers**.
