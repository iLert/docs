After enabling the support hours routing option you can enable the specific support hours of your use case and select the routing targets for inside and outside of those hours.

You may only select routing targets \(escalation policies\) which are added above in the **IVR menu**.

To be able to route to the voicemail as specific target, you will have to enable the voicemail in the settings below.
