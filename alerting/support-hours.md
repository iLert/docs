# Support hours

3. Select the team to which the support hours belong to (if any), give it a name, and enter your support hours.
4. Click **Save**. You can now use these support hours in [alert sources](alert-sources.md#notification-priority-and-support-hours) and call routing numbers to set notification priority of alerts and route incoming call routing calls to different targets based on support hours.

### Holidays

The holiday feature is a part of Support hours in ilert. It provides a smart way to handle exceptions to your regular support schedule—like national holidays, company-wide days off, or any non-standard workday—without needing to adjust your on-call rotations or escalation policies manually.

To set up holidays, choose the Support hours you would like to adjust and click **Edit**.

At the bottom, you will see the “**Holiday exceptions**” section.&#x20;

You can either import holidays from a calendar or manually create them. If you decide on the first option, you can adjust the location and the exact dates you want to include or exclude. Adjust the time and click **Import**.

If you want to add exceptions manually, you will need to assign the title, duration, and support status for this period.&#x20;
