{% hint style="info" %}
It is important to know that incoming calls originating from call routing numbers are not muted. We advise to implement schedule overrides as a way to manage these cases.
{% endhint %}

**Visibility to Colleagues:**

When 'Mute Notifications' is active, your avatar will display a crossed-out bell icon. This signals to your team members that you are not receiving notifications during this time.
