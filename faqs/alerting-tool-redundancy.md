# Do monitoring tools that send alerts make iLert redundant?

**Our monitoring system is already capable of sending SMS messages when issues are encountered. Does this make iLert redundant?**

Merely sending SMS messages constitutes a "send and forget" strategy, and does not represent a reliable method of communication. iLert follows up on the delivery of each single message and reacts automatically when the recipient does not respond. This could be in the form of, for example, a telephone call following an unanswered email, or the forwarding of an alert to the next point of contact in the escalation chain.
