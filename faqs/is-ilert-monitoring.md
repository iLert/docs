# Is iLert a piece of monitoring software?

**Is iLert a piece of monitoring software \(such as Nagios\)?**

iLert is build around its IT alerting core software and therefore not a substitute for all monitoring software. However iLert offers deeply integrated uptime monitoring for websites and other tcp / udp services. iLert alerting extends the communication capabilities of your existing monitoring systems to SMS and phone alerts \(calls and push notifications\), and centralizes the alerting process.
