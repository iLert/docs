# Is ilert a piece of monitoring software?

**Is ilert a piece of monitoring software \(such as Nagios\)?**

ilert is build around its IT alerting core software and therefore not a substitute for all monitoring software. However ilert offers deeply integrated uptime monitoring for websites and other tcp / udp services. ilert alerting extends the communication capabilities of your existing monitoring systems to SMS and phone alerts \(calls and push notifications\), and centralizes the alerting process.
