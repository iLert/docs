# Does ilert have some sort of filtering mechanism?

**I don't want to be notified of every single alert in my monitoring system. Does ilert have some sort of filtering mechanism?**

Yes, ilert has filtering mechanisms. For each individual alert source, it is possible to define which alerts should be ignored, or which should be bundled into a common alert. For example, alerts can be automatically deduplicated or filtered according to specific words.
