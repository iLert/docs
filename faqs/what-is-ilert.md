# What is iLert?

**What is iLert?**

iLert is a software for alerting, on-call management and uptime monitoring and helps dev and ops teams to increase the uptime of critical services. Core features of iLert include

* **Reliable alerting** via voice, SMS, push notifications, Slack and more and frictionless acknowledgement, allowing you acknowledge an alert on the same channel where you reveived the alert \(e.g. by replying to an SMS\).
* **On-call management & escalations**: easily manage on-call duty with on-call schedules and automatic escalations.
* **Uptime & performance monitoring:** monitor your website, server, or API using various checks such as HTTP, ICMP ping or TCP.
* **Call routing:** route incoming calls using on-call schedules and escalation policies to the right on-call person.

iLert integrates with monitoring, ticketing, chat, and collaboration tools.
