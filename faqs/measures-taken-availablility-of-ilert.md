# Availability of ilert services

**What measures have been taken to ensure continuous uptime for ilert?**

iLert's infrastructure is distributed across three data centers which are independent from each other and at different physical locations. All data is replicated between both centers in real-time. Each component is structurally redundant such that the failure of a single component does not jeopardize the functioning of ilert. This is also the case with our phone and SMS providers. We work with 3 providers for each communication method. We also conduct daily backups.

You can always check the uptime status of ilert services [here](http://status.ilert.com).
