# Coverage requests

ilert’s **Coverage requests** feature allows users to request coverage for their on-call shifts from colleagues. Rather than directly overriding or reassigning a shift, Coverage requests create a lightweight workflow where the requester asks a colleague to take over specific shifts. This is especially helpful if you need to step away from your on-call duties for a personal appointment, an unexpected emergency or personal time-off.

Currently, coverage requests are mobile-only, meaning requests can only be created, viewed, and managed in the ilert mobile app.

### Key benefits

* Collaboration: Allows on-call team members to coordinate coverage among themselves without admin intervention.
* Flexibility: Users can select exact shifts within a desired time period and send a request for coverage.
* Transparency: Both the requester and the recipient can track the status of each request - pending, accepted, or declined.

### How it differs from an override

* Coverage Request: A request-based workflow. The requester asks a teammate to cover one or more specific shifts. The teammate must accept or decline.
* Override (requires [User permission](../user-administration/user-roles-and-permissions.md)): An admin can directly reassign a shift without requiring acceptance. Any responder can add themselves as an override for any shift, but cannot add another person.

### Creating a coverage request

1. Open the ilert mobile app. Ensure you have the latest version installed on your iOS or Android device.

### Responding to coverage requests

When someone requests coverage from you:

1. You’ll receive a push notification and a badge on the requests tab in the ilert mobile app.
2. Open **Coverage requests** from the main navigation. Review the shift dates/times and any message from the requester.

3. **Accept** or **Decline**

* Tap **Accept** if you can cover the shift.
* Tap **Decline** if you’re unable to cover.
* Once you choose, both you and the requester will be notified of the decision.

### FAQs

#### Can I send coverage requests from the ilert web app?

Not at this time. Coverage requests are available only via the ilert mobile app.

#### Can an admin override my shift if I send a coverage request?

Yes. Admins retain the ability to directly override or reassign shifts, which bypasses the request/accept workflow.

#### Can I cancel a request after sending it?

Yes. Navigate to **Coverage requests** in the mobile app, locate the request, and select **Cancel** if your colleague hasn’t already accepted.
