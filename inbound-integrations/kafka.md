# Kafka Integration

[Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) is a distributed event store and stream-processing platform. It is an open-source system developed by the Apache Software Foundation and written in Java and Scala. The project aims to provide a unified, high-throughput, low-latency platform for handling real-time data feeds. While ilert doesn't directly support a Kafka broker to accept the publishing of messages, it does support integrations specifically meant to connect Kafka topics to ilert events and provide the **ilagent** tool to connect your Kafka brokers to ilert without actually writing the code yourself.

## In ilert: Create an Apache Kafka alert source <a href="#create-alert-source" id="create-alert-source"></a>

1.  Go to **Alert sources** -> **Alert sources** and click on **Create new alert source.**\

2.  Search for **Apache Kafka** in the search field, click on the Apache Kafka tile, and click **Next**. \

3. Give your alert source a name, optionally assign teams, and click **Next**.
4.  Select an **escalation policy** by creating a new one or assigning an existing one.\

5.  Select your [Alert grouping](../alerting/alert-sources.md#alert-grouping) preference and click **Continue setup**. You may click **Do not group alerts** for now and change it later. \

6. The next page shows additional settings, such as customer alert templates or notification priority. Click on **Finish setup** for now.
7.  On the final page, an API key and/or webhook URL will be generated, which you will need later in this guide.

## In your environment

**Foreword**: you are free to use any Apache Kafka client to subscribe to your topics and wire them into an API call to `POST api.ilert.com/api/v1/kafka/{your-key-here}` (the endpoint accepts the payload of our generic [event API](https://api.ilert.com/api-docs/#tag/events/post/events).Â See also this [eventing guide](../rest-api/api-samples/creating-alerts-through-events.md)).

However, if you don't wish to write your own software to wire subscriber and POST requests, you may use our _swiss-army-knife tool_ **ilagent** which supports a Kafka mode where it subscribes to a specific Kafka topic to deliver events or heartbeats to ilert; it automatically uses the consumer (commit) offsets to support retries as well. It is open source and can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/iLert/ilagent).

While you may [compile the binary](https://github.com/iLert/ilagent?tab=readme-ov-file#compile-the-binary-from-source) locally, we also support an official Docker image [ilert/ilagent](https://hub.docker.com/r/ilert/ilagent/tags) which can be used to get started quickly.

### Consume a topic and turn messages into events

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note: Your messages need to be in the format of the ilert event API schema; at least: `{apiKey, eventType, summary}`
{% endhint %}

```
docker run -p 8977:8977 ilert/ilagent daemon -p 8977 -v -v \
    --kafka_brokers kafka-bootstrap-host:9092 --kafka_group_id ilagentsub -e 'test-topic'
```

You can always check `docker run ilert/ilagent --help` for a full list of arguments.

If you don't want to provide the apiKey in every message, you can overwrite with the `--event_key 'il1api123...'` argument.

### Transform any kind of message into events

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note: Your messages need to be JSON.
{% endhint %}

The **ilagent** also supports basic event key overwrites so you can map any message top-level keys into an event payload.

```
docker run -p 8977:8977 ilert/ilagent daemon -v -v \
    --kafka_brokers kafka-bootstrap-host:9092 --kafka_group_id ilagentsub -e 'test-topic' \
    --event_key 'il1api123...' \
    --map_key_alert_key 'mCode' \
    --map_key_summary 'comment' \
    --map_key_etype 'state' \
    --map_val_etype_alert 'SET' \
    --map_val_etype_accept 'ACK' \
    --map_val_etype_resolve 'CLR' \
    --filter_key 'type' \
    --filter_val 'ALARM'
```

The top sample code will subscribe to the test-topic and filter every message for `message.type == 'ALERT'` it will then map the field `message.state: SET => ALERT, ACK => ACCEPT and CLR => RESOLVE` to the `event.eventType` additionally `message.mCode` will be used as `event.alertKey` and `message.comment as event.summary`.&#x20;

With these flexible arguments, you may quickly prototype or start your alert management without writing and deploying a custom mapper.

_If you are using this subscriber bridge for critical scenarios, make sure to read the section on Kafka at least once delivery guarantee in the ilagent readme._

### FAQ

#### My local docker ilert/ilagent does not connect to my broker

In case your broker is running in docker as well, you cannot simply use localhost to connect, you will need to link your broker to your ilagent container with `--link broker-container-name:broker-container-name` then provide `-m broker-container-name` so that your ilagent actually connects to your broker.
