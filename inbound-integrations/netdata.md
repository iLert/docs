# Netdata Integration

[Netdata](https://www.netdata.cloud/) is a high-performance, open-source monitoring tool that provides real-time insights into system and application metrics. It allows users to track and visualize performance data across distributed systems with minimal resource overhead. Pairing Netdata with ilertâ€™s incident management platform enhances the monitoring experience by adding powerful alerting and incident response capabilities. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to connect Netdata with ilert.
