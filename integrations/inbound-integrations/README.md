# Inbound integrations

Inbound integrations, or [alert sources](https://docs.ilert.com/alerting/alert-sources), refer to the process of receiving events from external systems, like monitoring, observability, or ticketing solutions, into the ilert platform. ilert provides more than 100 integrations with third-party tools in its catalog. If you haven't found a tool you regularly use and want to connect with ilert, contact our [support team](mailto:support@ilert.com).
