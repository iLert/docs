# GitHub Integration

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a web-based platform that provides hosting for software development and a robust version control system using Git. With Github, developers can manage and track changes to their code, collaborate with other developers, and also utilize various built-in GitHub features such as pull requests, issues, actions, and a marketplace of tools and extensions.
