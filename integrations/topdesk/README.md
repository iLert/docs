# TOPdesk Integration

[TOPdesk](https://www.topdesk.com/en/) is a modular service management software that helps businesses manage IT support, facilities management, HR, and other services. It provides a centralized platform for ticketing, asset management, and workflow automation.

Through ilert's integration with TOPdesk, incidents in ilert can be automatically generated from TOPdesk tickets while also enhancing TOPdesk with reliable alerting (via phone calls, SMS, push notifications, and more) on-call scheduling and automatic escalations.
