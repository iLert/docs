# SolarWinds Integration

With the ilert SolarWinds Integration you can easily integrate SolarWinds Orion products (eg [NPM](https://www.solarwinds.com/network-performance-monitor) and [SAM](https://www.solarwinds.com/server-application-monitor)) into ilert. The integration extends SolarWinds with SMS, push and voice notification as well as on-call schedules from ilert. Alerts are created in ilert and automatically resolved. Furthermore, alerts in ilert that were created by SolarWinds contain links to the respective alerts in SolarWinds.

## FAQ <a href="#faq" id="faq"></a>

**Are alerts automatically resolved in ilert?**

Yes, as soon as the **reset condition** for an alert has occurred in SolarWinds, the associated alert in ilert is resolved.

**What if an alert is acknowledged in SolarWinds, is the associated alert also acknowledged in ilert?**

No, in SolarWinds it is unfortunately not possible to perform an action after an **acknowledge**.

**Can I link SolarWinds to multiple alert sources in ilert?**

Yes, create several alert definitions in SolarWinds and store the corresponding URL of the alert source from ilert in the HTTP URL.

**What if my internet connection is lost? Are the alerts generated in SolarWinds lost?**

No, no alerts are lost if you have activated the option **Repeat this action action every X minutes until the alert is acknowledged** in SolarWinds (see above). We also recommend that you monitor your Internet connection with an external monitoring service, such as ilert's [Uptime monitoring](https://www.ilert.com/product/uptime-monitoring/).

**Can I change the content of the alert in ilert (e.g. the summary)?**

Yes, you can configure this in the definition of the trigger action. In the HTTP Post Body, several variables in the format `variable1=value1&variable2=value2&variable3=value3...` are sent to ilert. To change the summary text of the alert, change the definition of the variable `iLertEventSummary` . All other variables that you add below `iLertEventSummary` inserted in the description of the alert.

**The integration doesn't work. How do I find the issue?**

If you do not find the error, please contact our support at [support@ilert.com](mailto:support@ilert.com).
