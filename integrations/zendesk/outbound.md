# Zendesk Outbound Integration

[Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.com/) is a cloud-based help desk management solution offering customizable tools to build customer service portal, knowledge base and online communities.

## In Zendesk: Create API Token <a href="#api-token" id="api-token"></a>

1. Optional: create a dedicated ilert user in Zendesk. That way, you will be able to distinguish tickets created by ilert.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Admin permission required**

To set up the integration, the Zendesk user must have agent permissions.
{% endhint %}

1. Go to admin settings, select the API channel, enable token access and create an API token.&#x20;

## FAQ <a href="#faq" id="faq"></a>

**Are tickets updated in Zendesk if the alert is updated in ilert?**

Yes, status updates to ilert Alerts are reflected in the title of the Zendesk ticket, e.g. `RESOLVED` host compute.infra is `DOWN`.

**Can I choose which updates to publish to a ticket in Zendesk?**

Currently not. If that's something you'd like see in ilert, we look forward to your feedback via chat or e-mail.
