# Types of integrations

ilert integrations connect your tools and workflows for efficient incident management and reliable alerting. They are organized into three categories:

1. **Inbound Integrations**\
   Also called [alert sources](/alerting/alert-sources), they enable you to connect monitoring tools, ticketing systems, or applications to ilert for reliable incident alerting. Use pre-built integrations, email, Event API, SMS, or heartbeat monitoring to create and manage incidents effectively.
2. **CI/CD integrations**\
   [Deployment events](/alerting/deployment-events) enrich incidents by bringing deployment activity, such as releases or merges, into your ilert incident management platform.
3. **Outbound Integrations**\
   Known as connectors and [alert actions](/#connector-and-alert-action-aka-outbound-integration), outbound integrations let you automate incident responses. Update status pages, create tickets in JIRA, or send notifications to Slack to ensure timely and coordinated incident response.
