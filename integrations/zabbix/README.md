# Zabbix Integration

[Zabbix](https://www.zabbix.com/) is an open-source tool designed for real-time monitoring of networks, servers, virtual machines, and cloud services. With ilertâ€™s Zabbix integration, you can automatically create incidents in ilert based on triggers in Zabbix and alert the on-call person through multiple channels, such as phone calls, SMS, push notifications, Slack, and more.

### Select your Zabbix version:

{% content-ref url="native.md" %}
[native.md](native.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="script.md" %}
[script.md](script.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
