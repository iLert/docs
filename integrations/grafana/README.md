# Grafana Integration

[Grafana](https://grafana.com/) is an open-source platform for monitoring and visualization. It allows developers to create, explore, and share dashboards, which display real-time data from various sources like databases, cloud services, and even IoT devices. Grafana supports a wide range of data sources, including Prometheus, InfluxDB, Elasticsearch, and many more. It's highly customizable, allowing you to define alerts, apply various data transformations, and create complex time-series queries. DevOps commonly use it for performance monitoring, system health checks, and data analysis.

The Grafana integration with ilert allows you to get Grafana alerts through various channels such as SMS, phone calls, push notifications, Slack, among others. When Grafana triggers an alert, ilert informs the appropriate individual, following on-call schedules and escalation policies until the alert is acknowledged.
