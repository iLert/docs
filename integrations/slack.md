# Slack Integration

## FAQ <a id="faq"></a>

**Can I link multiple Slack Workspaces to one iLert account?**

No, only one Slack workspace can be linked to an iLert account.

**Are updates to an incident published in Slack?**

Yes, the following updates for an incident are currently being published:

* **Escalations** : An incident is automatically assigned to another user.
* **Manual assignments** : An incident is assigned to someone manually.
* **Actions** : An incident is accepted or corrected.

**Can I choose which updates to an incident are published in Slack?**

Yes.

**Can I manage alert sources from private teams using the `/ilert` Slash command?**

No, alert sources of private teams can only  be added via the iLert web interface, in the alert source's **Incident actions** configuration tab.

**Why am I not seeing all of my Slack channels in the Connections UI?**

This could be due to missing permission for private channels. Please try to invite the iLert Slack Bot into the desired \(missing\) channels and refresh the page.
