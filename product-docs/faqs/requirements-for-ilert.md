# Which requirements does ilert have?

**Do I need to have a phone line available in order to use ilert?**

No. ilert is offered as a pure Software as a Service solution and has no specific hardware or software assumptions nor requirements. This means you do not need to have a phone line, server, or any other component in order to use the software.
