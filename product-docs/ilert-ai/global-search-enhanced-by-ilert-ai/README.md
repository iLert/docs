The result window gives you a quick glance over all resource types in your account that match the search term. ilert uses a hybrid search approach that mixes full-text search and vector similarity with reranking to provide you with the best results to your search, even if your search term is not exactly matching.

### Drilling down deeper

You may drill down into more results for a specific category, this will widen the vectorized search part as well, trying to resolve even more results. Just **click on a category header** of your search results.
