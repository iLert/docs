# Microsoft Teams Integration via Workflows

{% hint style="warning" %}
If possible we suggest to use [iLert's Microsoft Teams Bot](./) for the setup, this guide and integration is only suggested in case you do not want to grant any permissions to ilert
{% endhint %}

## In Microsoft Teams: Add a workflow to a channel <a href="#add-to-channel" id="add-to-channel"></a>

{% hint style="info" %}
**Admin permission required**

To set up the integration, you must have admin rights in ilert.
