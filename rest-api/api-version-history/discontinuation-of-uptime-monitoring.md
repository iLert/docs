{% hint style="info" %}
Uptime monitors will be discontinued after June 30, 2024.
{% endhint %}

In June 2023, we sent the following announcement to our customers

> At ilert, we are constantly evaluating our product offerings to ensure we provide the best value and experience for our customers. With this in mind, we have an important announcement regarding our service offerings.
>
> After careful consideration, we have decided to discontinue our uptime monitoring feature. As of January 2023, we stopped offering uptime monitoring for new customers, and now we are extending this decision to existing customers. This change will allow us to focus on our core offerings and improve the overall customer experience with ilert. We understand that this may come as a surprise, so we want to assure you that this decision was made with your best interests in mind.
>
> Here are the main reasons behind this decision:
>
> 1. Vendor Neutrality and Partnerships: By discontinuing uptime monitoring, we can maintain our vendor-neutral position for monitoring and avoid any potential conflicts of interest when engaging in partnerships with vendors of uptime monitoring software. This will ultimately benefit our customers by providing a more diverse and robust selection of tools and services.
> 2. Focus on Core Offerings: By removing uptime monitoring, we can better allocate engineering resources to enhance our core offerings. This will enable us to deliver even greater value to you and improve the overall ilert experience.
>
> We understand that this transition may be challenging for some customers, which is why we will provide a 12-month grace period until we entirely remove the uptime monitoring feature. Existing customers will be able to continue using uptime monitoring until Jun 5, 2024.
>
> In light of this change, we recommend Checkly as an alternative solution for your uptime monitoring needs. Checkly offers a Terraform provider, making it a suitable choice for existing users of ilert's uptime monitoring that rely on automation. ilert also seamlessly integrates with Checkly. Please see our Checkly integration guidefor more information.
>
> We appreciate your understanding and support during this transition. Should you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out to us. We are here to help you through this process and ensure a smooth transition.
>
> Thank you for your continued trust in ilert, and we look forward to serving you with our enhanced focus on incidents response and communication.
